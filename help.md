## Using The Bot

In order to use the bot, you must use the slash command: '/authenticate'

To enter this command, just type '/authenticate' (minus the single quotes ('')), and only that, into the text entry bar of the server with the bot in it.

Once this command is entered, the bot will wait for you to upload a photo. Once the photo is uploaded, the bot will then apply the 'Student' role to you.

## Taking A Photo

When taking the photo to use, keep some things in mind, and ensure that:
-The ID is upright and level
-That the ID is clearly visible
-The ID is the focus of the picture

If you do not, then the bot may not recognise the ID, and deny your authentication.

## Uploading A Photo

Uploading a photo on discord is very simple. This can be done on either your phone, or on your computer.

### On Computer (The Discord Program):

If you are using a computer, then once you have entered the '/authenticate' command on the desired server, simply click the '+' symbol to the left of the text entry bar, and selecting 'Upload a File' from the menu that pops up.

From there, simply navigate to the desired photo image file you wish to upload to the bot, and select it. 

Once you have selected the photo you wish to use, a message box will pop up asking if you wish to add a caption. Ignore this, and simply click 'Upload', and the photo will be uploaded to Discord, for the bot to read.

Upon a successful read, the bot will assign you your role. If the authentication fails, try taking another photo of your ID, and using that one instead.

### On Mobile (The Discord App):

If you are using a phone, then once you have entered the '/authenticate' command on the desired server, touch the '+' symbol to the left of the text entry bar, and then select the photo you wish to use from the photos you have taken, and once selected, hit the 'enter message' button to the right of the text entry bar.

Alternatively, you can choose the option labelled 'Camera', to directly take a photo of your ID, and choose that one. If you choose this, then take the photo, then select 'Use Photo', and then hit the 'enter message' button ont he right of the text entry bar.

Upon a successful read, the bot will assign you your role. If the authentication fails, try taking another photo of your ID, and using that one instead.

## Failed Authentication

If the bot fails to authenticate you, don't worry! It is likely that the specific image you used has a problem. To solve this, simply take a new photo, keeping the ID clearly visible, and try again with that image.
