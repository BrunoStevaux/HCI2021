# COMP 3583 HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTIONS PROJECT

## **What is it?**

Our group project's goal is to automate the authentication of discord members as University students.

### **How does it work?**

Using OCR (Open Character Recognition), your student Name and ID can be validated and authenticated.

We use two different OCR engines:

- Google Vision Label
- Tesseract OCR

DiscordJS handles the interactions between users and the OCR engines while also handling the validation process.

## How to use

Work in progress
